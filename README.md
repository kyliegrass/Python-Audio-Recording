# Python-Audio-Recording
With only ten lines of code and the use of two Python libraries, we can record any audio for a specified amount of time. The audio will be saved to the same location as the source code.

This is a simple voice recorder program, written in Python. Users have to set the time limit and run the program. After that specific time, the program will stop and a file will be created with .wav extension in the same location as the source-code.

<h2>What the program does?</h2>

- Your default mic starts recording
- The recording is saved in the same locatoin of source-code
- After custorm time the program exits

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Python[ >= python3.1]
Python Libraries: sounddevice scipy
provide your required time in seconds for the record during the compilation
