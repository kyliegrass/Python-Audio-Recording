# Python-Audio-Recording
With only ten lines of code and the use of two Python libraries, we can record any audio for a specified amount of time. The audio will be saved to the same location as the source code.

This is a simple voice recorder program, written in Python. Users have to set the time limit and run the program. After that specific time, the program will stop and a file will be created with .wav extension in the same location as the source-code.
